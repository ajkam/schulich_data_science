    "What quarter does the company have best/worst sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data from quarter 4 are missing in 2024. The average was used instead of the sum. This shows that the best quarter is quarter 4. This is important it shows that the last quarter might cause a rush as managers might be scrambling to increase sales as managers want to meet their bonuses. On the other hand the first quarter is the worst on average which demonstrates that after the end of the year sales managers might be relaxed for the first quarter of the new year. The VP of Sales should look into creating bonuses per quarter so regional sales managers are incentived throughout the entire year. However it is important to look into whether this is because sales managers being lax or just due to the holiday season. Typically ecommerce companies have a surge of sales during the Christmas season and then during January very few people are purchasing. Therfore, before deciding on implementing quarterly bonuses the gap between q1 and q4 should invesetigated further to see if it caused by managers or seasonality."

    "This graph visualizes the average sales revenue by month. The top 3 months are July, October, and December. This explains in the previous result why Q4 is the most successful as it has 2 of the top 3 months. The bottom fourr months are September, Jaunary, February, and May. This explains why Q1 is the lowest as it has 2 of the worst months. This again demonstrates the seasonal trend for company. However data from q4 2024 is not included. One recommendation for the VP of Sales might be to employ department wide promotions on the bottom 4 months. This might help increase units_sold although a lower price_per_unit."

    "\n",
    "The above cell outputs the min and max sale. This reveals some interesting data as their are some abnormally high sales and low sales. For example the min sales in 2023 is less than a dollar which means that price_per_unit was abnormlly low. This should be investigated as it shows that there is no standard guideline for how much discounts are allowed per product. The regional managers are completely out of wack when it comes to charging prices. There needs to be a standard set by the Vice President of Sales at least for a mininum price for each product as this would ensure that the company maeks a profit on each sale. This holds true as unless the 0.99 sale revenue in 2023 and the 2.2 sale revenue in 2022 were a clearance sale it is unlikely that there was a return on investment for those sales.  "
